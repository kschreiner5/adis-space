            <p>
                There are many reasons for us to continue the exploration of space. One is to obtain new/more resources to supply our exponential
                expansion. For example, we can mine resources from asteroids to replace activities like strip mining and quarry's which destroy our
                planet's surface. Another reason is to create new economic oppurtunities with completly new materials, services, and needs.
                Another reason is to obtain new information to observe and study for new knowledge and understanding of science in a general
                sense. One more reason to continue ventering out into space is to spread life. There is no evidence of life other then us so it
                is our duty to insure that life continues and spreads in our universe. Those are a few major reasons to continue our exploration of space.
