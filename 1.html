                <p>
                    Our understanding of science has been revolutionized in all aspects with the exploration of space.
                    We have oberved, analyzed, and learned countless new facts and concepts about exogeology to physics to
                    biology. Some significant discoveries will be displayed in the following list.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Van Allen radiation belt was discovered by Explorer 1</li>
                    <li>The Hubble Space Telescope has observed countless objects with revolutionary clarity, including the Spiral Galaxy NGC 4414 which is shown below</li>
                    <li>The Juno Probe has discovered that Jupiter's bands which are jet streams are at least 1,864 miles deep</li>
                    <li>Multiple probes and rovers have directly studied the geology and climate of Mars, indicating that liquid water once existed on its surface</li>
                    <li>Thousands of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) have been discovered by a variety of telescopes on land and in space</li>
                    <li>Exoplanets were first proven to exist with the conformation of the planet "PSR B1257+12 B PSR B1257+12 C" in 1992</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    There are countless other discoveries made with observations from space which are simply not displayed on this list.
