                    The exploration of space has been going on for 62 years. It began in 1957 with the succesful launch of Sputnik 1,
                    a Soviet Satalite which initiated the Space Race. Many marvels were achomplished during that period of history in every aspect,
                    from understanding the human body to visiting our moon to understanding the nature of space. We studied the effects of micro-gravity
                    on the human body in programs like Project Mercury and Project Gemini in NASA, and Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin being the first
                    human in orbit. We visited and studied our moon in the Apollo Program. We studied and learned about every aspect of space and it's
                    relation to us in every single mission sent, successful or not. The end of the Space Race was not the end of Space Exploration.
                    We continue to explore and have achomplished many things such as taking pictures of pluto with Project Horizens, and living in
                    space for extended period of time in the International Space Station. We have taken pictures of exoplanets (planets outside of our solar system)
                    with Kepler Space Telescope, and we have taken pictures of galaxies with the Hubble Space Telescope. The next few pages will go into further depth
                    of our exploration of space.
