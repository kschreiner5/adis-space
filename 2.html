                    The exploration of space requires us to be innovative to be succesful.The development of spacecraft, instruments,
                    and tools for use in space advances our technology in all aspects.The most prominent example of technological development
                    for space exploration directly effecting everyday life is the fact that our period in time is known as the Communications Age.
                    The existence of GPS and international communicationis due to a complex infrastructure of communication satitles in Low Earth
                    Orbit. The development, creation, and placement of those satellites is what allows every vehicle to know its exact location, and
                    communication between continents and thousands of miles viable. Another aspect of the Communication Age is widespread electronics
                    which are possible due to the development of the integrated circuit (a revolutionary technology at the time) in the Apollo Program in 1958.
                    The integrated circuit directly lead to the development of the microchip, which is a part of every electronic. The integrated circuit
                    was developed because a lighter and more energy effiecent computer was required for the Apollo spacecraft. There are countless other aspects
                    of life that have been improved by space travel such as sleep (memory foam was developed for pilot seats), emergency tools (the Jaws of Life
                    use the same concept as explosive bolts used in the Space Shuttle), insulation (radiant barrier was developed for use in space), etc. That is
                    how technological development for space exploration has directly effected our everyday life.
